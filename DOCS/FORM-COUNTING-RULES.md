# FORM COUNTING RULES WITH EXAMPLES

## FORM COUNTING PRINCIPLES

### IMA (Investment Management Agreement)
COUNT: 1 per household (if sharing visibility) OR 1 per person (if not sharing)
EXAMPLE: Bob + Jane (married, sharing visibility) = 1 IMA
EXAMPLE: Bob + Jane (not sharing visibility) = 2 IMAs

// HOUSEHOLDS ALWAYS (husband and wife) SHARE VISIBILITY. unless instructed otherwise. Assume they share visibility by default.

### ROLLOVER COMPLIANCE FORM
COUNT: 1 per tax ID with rollover activity
EXAMPLE: Bob IRA rollover + Jane IRA rollover = 2 forms (each person files separately)
EXAMPLE: Bob has 3 IRAs all rolling over = 1 form (same tax ID)
NEVER REQUIRED: Trust accounts (even if rollover)

### SCHWAB ACCOUNT APPLICATION
COUNT: 1 per account being opened
EXAMPLE: Bob individual + Jane individual + Joint account = 3 applications
EXAMPLE: Bob has 4 new accounts = 4 applications
SPECIAL: Use LPOA instead if accounts already exist at Schwab

### SCHWAB LPOA (Limited Power of Attorney)
COUNT: 1 per tax ID (covers all existing accounts under that tax ID)
EXAMPLE: Bob has 2 individual + 1 IRA at Schwab = 1 LPOA (same tax ID)
EXAMPLE: Bob individual + Jane individual + their Joint = 3 LPOAs (different tax IDs)
EXAMPLE: Trust account existing = 1 LPOA (trust's tax ID)

### SCHWAB TRANSFER OF ASSETS (ACAT)
COUNT: 1 per delivering account from external custodian
EXAMPLE: Bob has 2 accounts at Fidelity + 1 at Vanguard = 3 transfer forms
EXAMPLE: Bob has 3 accounts all at Fidelity = 3 transfer forms (one per account)

### SCHWAB ACH AUTHORIZATION
COUNT: 1 per Schwab account per bank link
EXAMPLE: 3 Schwab accounts all linking to same bank = 3 ACH forms
EXAMPLE: 1 Schwab account linking to 2 different banks = 2 ACH forms
EXAMPLE: 3 Schwab accounts × 2 banks each = 6 ACH forms

### SCHWAB CHECK AND JOURNAL AUTHORIZATION
COUNT: 1 form per journal instruction (each directional transfer needs own form)
EXAMPLE: Sue Individual → Joint + Tom Individual → Joint + Sue → Tom = 3 forms
EXAMPLE: Monthly journal from Account A → Account B = 1 form
EXAMPLE: Check writing for 3 accounts = could be 1 form listing all OR 3 separate

## KEY MULTIPLICITY LEVELS
- Household-level: IMA (if sharing), Disclosure
- Tax ID-level: Rollover Compliance Form, LPOA
- Account-level: Account Application, Transfer Form (per delivering account)
- Bank instruction-level: ACH Form (account × bank combinations)
- Journal-level: Check and Journal Authorization (per directional instruction)
- Trust exception: Never requires Rollover Form regardless of funding

## FORM FIELD COMPLETION RULES

### Account Applications:
- Account number: For NEW accounts write "TBD" (no number exists yet)
- Trusted contact: optional
- IRA beneficiaries: name and percentage required

### ACH Forms:
- Pre-account opening: account number = "TBD"
- If already under custody: use existing account number
- Account type: always specify (Individual, IRA, Trust, Joint)
- One form per account-bank combination

### Check and Journal Forms:
- Each directional journal needs separate form
- Can consolidate check writing for multiple accounts on one form

### IMA Fields:
- List all clients in household
- List all account numbers, OR if opening: "TBD-IRA", "TBD-INDV", etc.
- Household aggregation is ok

### Rollover Compliance Form:
- Tax ID required
- One per person regardless of account count
- Skip for trust entities

### LPOA Fields:
- Covers all existing accounts under same tax ID
- Joint accounts have separate tax ID from individual accounts
